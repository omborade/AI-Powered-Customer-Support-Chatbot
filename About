This code uses the following technologies:
Express.js: A Node.js framework for building web applications
Dialogflow: A Google Cloud service for building conversational interfaces
Body-parser: A middleware library for parsing incoming requests
Here's how the code works:



The user sends a message to the chatbot through a web interface or mobile app.
The message is sent to the server as a JSON payload.
The server uses the Dialogflow client to detect the intent behind the user's message.
The intent is matched to a predefined response in the intents object.
The response is sent back to the user as a JSON payload.
